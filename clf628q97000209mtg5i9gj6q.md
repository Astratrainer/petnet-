Question 1: What is Culture?

Answer: Culture refers to the shared beliefs, values, customs, behaviours, and artifacts that characterize a group or society. It encompasses the ways of life of people within a particular social group, including their language, religion, arts, music, food, and dress. Culture is learned and transmitted from one generation to another through socialization, communication, and imitation.

Culture plays a significant role in shaping human behaviour and shaping individual and collective identities. It provides a framework for people to interpret and make sense of their experiences and their world. Culture is dynamic and constantly evolving, as societies interact with each other, undergo changes, and adopt new practices and ideas. Understanding and appreciating cultural diversity is crucial for building empathy, fostering mutual respect, and promoting social harmony in a globalized world.
