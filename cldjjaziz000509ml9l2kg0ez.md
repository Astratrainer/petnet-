***<mark>1-minute presentation preparation: AI, IoT, Sensors and Drone</mark>***

This world is evolving so fast as we can see many changes nowadays. There are lots of AI tools and websites which use certain algorithms to process concepts to work. As we can see robots such as Sophie who has also got citizenship and work. We can lots of sensors that are used for households in the cars such as Tesla which uses the sensors at its peak for auto driving. And many used drones for fire detection and delivery and rescue purposes. I am very excited about what is coming in the upcoming time.
