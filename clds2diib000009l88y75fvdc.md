# 2nd day of PY

Adjourne - Finished some kind of topic.

Agenda - major topics that we are going to discuss.

Meeting Technology:

The technology used in the meeting: Projectors, VC - controls the motion and sound sensor when someone is talking. **A VC pitch deck** is a presentation (typically in Powerpoint, Google Sheets or PDF) used to explain a startup idea to potential venture capital investors. A pitch deck contains information on the business, the market and the company's traction/financials

# Metting mistakes

1. To allocate time, most of the organizers share the wrong time with the other party. It is always better Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST).
    

Better to put the mint in the middle of the table while having the meeting. Better to take some tissues during the meeting and a hanky is for ladies.

Better to have an item on the left and put the tickbox aside the item number on the topic that you are going to discuss. AOB - any other business.

On the right, it has to have a responsible person and the person who is accountable for the meeting or any other.
